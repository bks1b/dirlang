# Dirlang
Dirlang is an esoteric programming language based on directories. This repository includes a JavaScript compiler as well as an interpreter, however, compilation is much faster.

# Syntax
Other than directory names, Dirlang's syntax is completely different from text-based languages'. Directories are expected to be structured similarly to parse trees, recursively.
